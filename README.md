# wood-chipper
A utility script to break up monster Python files into smaller ones.

This scripts takes a large python file which (for now) only contains class definitions and import statements, and replaces it with a module which has one class per file. To run, execute
```
python3 wood_chipper.py your_large_file.py
```
